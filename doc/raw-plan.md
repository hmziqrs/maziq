Main goal is to have a fresh macbook installed with all necessary software and configurations for development work.

Software goals:
1 Version fetcher. Have a way to fetch latest versions of our listed software and save it a json file. this way when we bundle binary we will have reference of latest versions. (This would be done on compile time)
2 Status checker if a softawre is installed or needs to be updated.
3 remover for uninstalling software.

Onboarding.
1 Fresh installation. it should have template support so other developers can add their own software list. Altough recommended would be mine "hmziq"
2 Manager for installing and updating software.


Configurator.
1 list. list of our installed installed setup Configurations.
2 install. (For now this will only be for git, ssh, gpg key, email, username & set default branch to master, that pull upstream to be rebase). Also put the label to no use it as it's experimintal.
